# DeepQ-MultiAgent

Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has recently attracted much attention from the communities of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and multi-agent systems. As an interdisciplinary research field, there are so many unsolved problems, from cooperation to competition, from agent communication to agent modeling, from centralized learning to decentralized learning. MARL has been the main research focus of our lab. We are investigating the field from many perspectives. In the following, we introduce some of our studies. For detail, please refer to the papers.

In multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), the learning rates of actors and critic are mostly hand-tuned and fixed. This not only requires heavy tuning but more importantly limits the learning. With adaptive learning rates according to gradient patterns, some optimizers have been proposed for general optimizations, which however do not take into consideration the characteristics of MARL.

This repository is in testing stages.
